In this task, I worked with the Titanic dataset to explore and understand the data better. I started by loading the dataset and generating summary statistics to get an overview of the numbers. I checked for missing values and looked at basic data quality.

I then created histograms and boxplots for important features like Age and Fare to see their distributions and spot any outliers. To understand how different features are related, I plotted a correlation heatmap and built a pairplot to visualize patterns, especially focusing on survival rates.

Finally, I analyzed how survival chances varied with passenger class and gender using bar plots. Throughout the process, I mainly used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling and visualization
